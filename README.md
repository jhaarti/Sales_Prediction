LINEAR REGRESSION.
The dataset can be downloaded online, and that is given in the comment of the notebook.
Here, we are using linear regression to predict the sales of a company based upon the expenses made over advertisement sources, such as TV, Newspaper, Radio.
We try to figure out or analyse which advertisement source provides more profit for the sales.
