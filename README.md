# Sales_Prediction
LINEAR REGRESSION.
The dataset can be downloaded online from here: 'http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv' .
Here, we are using linear regression to predict the sales of a company based upon the expenses made over advertisement sources, such as TV, Newspaper, Radio.
We try to figure out or analyse which advertisement source provides more profit for the sales.
